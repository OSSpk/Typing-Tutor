A visually appealing and interactive Typing Tutor game made using C++. 

It was made as a final project for my course Introduction to Computing CS101 during my 1st Semester at [National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences](http://nu.edu.pk/).

## How to Run

If you would like to run the .exe directly from the file explorer:

Click the code dropdown and download the project folder.
Navigate to the download location and into the Code folder.
Right click on the "Typing Tutor.exe" file to run it.

If you would like to work on and run the project within an IDE:

Follow the same steps as previous to download the repository.
Open the project in your IDE.
Open a terminal window from within the Code folder.

Powershell:
Typing ```.\Typing Tutor.exe``` will not work as the name has a space.
Instead, type the command "& '.\Typing Tutor.exe'"
A faster way to type this is to start with ```.\Typing``` and then press TAB.
The TAB will autocomplete the command for you to the command shown above.
It may autocomplete to ```& '.\Typing Tutor.cbp'```, so just replace the cbp with exe afterwards.

Git Bash:
Git Bash does not recognize the ```&``` so you will just omit it to run the executable.
```'.\Typing Tutor.exe``` will start the game.
Note that TAB for autocomplete is not built into Git Bash.
If you would like to use autocomplete here, download the appropriate bash completion package.

If "Typing Tutor.exe" isn't working then the game can be compiled using any of the two ways:

1) The project is compiled using Code Blocks. So, there is a file named "Typing Tutor.cbp". Open it in Code Blocks and the whole project will load up with all files. Then just click "Build and Run" and the game will start. {Add the libgdi32 library in Code Blocks using project->build options->linker settings-> add button (find libgdi32 for your compiler)} 

2) To have the best experience it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to compile the main.cpp file of the game using G++
using the command:
 ```g++ -o main.exe mygraphics.cpp myconsole.cpp main.cpp - lgdi32```

Instructions to Play the Game                      
-----------------------------
The rules of my game "Typing Tutor" are :

--  You are provided with a Typing Box . A Box is shown moving vertically on the screen with a
    word in it.There are five still boxes containing words.
 
--  If you type the word shown in the moving box , correctly, then the moving box will
    start to move leftwards otherwise if you have entered an incorrect word in the Typing
    Box then you will lose one life .
 
--  When the moving Box collides with a still box (after the moving box has completely
    moved leftwards) , then if the words in both boxes are same , then your score
    will increase by one , otherwise you will lose one life. 

--  When the word you entered in the Typing Box do no match with that of the word in the Moving Box
    then your no. of lives will reduce by one .    

--  In order to win the game , you need to attain a score of 10 i.e by matching
    Ten times correctly .

--  You have a total of 5 lives in the beginning and if you lose all your lives i.e when you have
    0 lives , then you will lose the game and the game will end.

--  Once you have typed a character in the typing box , it cannot be removed by using
    BACKSPACE or DELETE key . So be careful while playing ;)

--  There are a total of four levels . Choose which ever level you want to play. Each one is more difficult than previous one.

Enjoy !!!!!!!
